# hello-world
This is a test to go through create repository process
now just pretend to finish readme, by including a description of what we are doing in this git repository.
Basically we are just opening a repository for exercise by using hello world example. we will include a source file and compilation information later.
So, readme is now finished, will go ahead close the issue.
